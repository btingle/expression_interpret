### expression_interpret

So I wrote this in both java and python. I tried to make the code as short as possible in the python version, whereas the java version is properly commented and formatted. They both do the same thing, however. Basically, it allows you to enter in a plaintext mathematical expression, like 1+1, or 5*(9+2), or sin(180), and the program will break it down and interpret it, spitting the result onto the screen. I consider this an improvement on my previous project, expression_compile, which basically does the same thing, but worse. This time, instead of going into it blind, I used an already tried and tested method, the shunting algorithm, to break down the expression into digestible chunks.

Anyways, this was a totally overkill submission for my compsci 101 class, maybe someone will find some use from it.
